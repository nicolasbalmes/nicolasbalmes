            Days. Weeks. Months. Why are you still here? You haven't left me. I still had not been able to assess myself alone. What's your deal? What do you want. These days are very much like the old days, although a bit confusing. The day you left never felt like the day I was left alone. We chose the path of going our separate ways, we were very clear on that. But why is it that you still appear, in a different form. Each day I ask myself that question and it never seemed to clear up my head. I know for sure we can never diverge, well for now. And it is very unhealthy to dwell on the thought of reconnecting
