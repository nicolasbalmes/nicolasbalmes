         It's been a few months now. You haven't called or texted. Simply, I've felt the absence of your presence. Now more than, real ever. I've been wondering to ask you how you've been doing. I know it's cliche for someone you have not dealt with recently. But if I ever I couuld not do that, I'd at least tell you how I am. Struggling, with life, but managing to survive. That sums about my priorities. Social-wise, a little bit monotous. Haven't felt any deep emotion for sometime. At first, it was refreshing. At least my mind is now clear, and my heart, rebooted. The fact that not knowing what happens next is somewhat exciting but dragging at the same time. Although I want to confess something. I still miss you.
