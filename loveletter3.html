                Thanks for seeing me yesterday. I couldn't tell you then how much great it felt hearing your voice. You told me a lot of things. You told me about how you are, what you're doing, and what you're planning to do. But what I really couldn't forget what was you told me in the end. I know, there is really no hope of being together, even just for now. But you stuck up to your gut and just let me go. Hearing those words were like a drug to me. It may have healed me or just made me worse. I didn't really think that pushing you away to care for myself would make me want you less, but instead just be hopeful for more. But now I know. And for that, thank you so much. Despite days of realistic hearbtreak lurking ahead, I'm really still hopeful. You finally set me free. I hope I can do the same with myself too.
